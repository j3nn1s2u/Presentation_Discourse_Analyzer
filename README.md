# Presentation Discourse Analyzer (PDA)
_A Human-Centered NLP Tool for Analyzing Student Presentation Structure_

PDA is a rule-based NLP system designed to help English teachers analyze the structural integrity of student presentations. Instead of replacing human judgment, it amplifies teacher expertise through systematic text analysis.

 - Built by: An English teacher transitioning to Computational Linguistics
 - Timeline: Spring 2025 (V1 Complete, V2-V3 in development)

## Key Features
 - Six-Category Classification: Opening, Background, Research & Value Creation, Marketing 4Ps, Action Ideas, Closing
 - Rule-Based Approach: Transparent, interpretable logic that teachers can understand and modify
 - Human-in-the-Loop Design: Teacher verification at every step
 - Binary Completeness Mapping: Visual overview of structural gaps

## System Architecture
Input Text → Preprocessing → Paragraph Classification → Human Verification → Text Analysis → Teacher Review → Feedback Output

## Three-Phase Development Plan
 - V1 Basic paragraph classifier (Completed)
 - V2 Structural completeness checker (Completed)
 - V3 Batch processing + visualization (Planned)
