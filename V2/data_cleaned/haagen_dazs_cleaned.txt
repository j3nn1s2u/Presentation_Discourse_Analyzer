Hello everyone, and thank you for being here. Today, we are going to introduce a brand that many of you might already love — Häagen-Dazs, a premium ice cream brand known not only for its delicious taste, but also for its strong presence on social media.

We chose this brand not only because of its strong social media marketing, but also because one of our group members currently works at Häagen-Dazs. From their experience, we learned how the brand uses Instagram to share beautiful images, emotional messages, and creative campaigns. Their content helps people feel the warmth and elegance of the brand, both online and in real life.

In our presentation today, we will share:
- The background of the brand
- How Häagen-Dazs creates value for its followers
- An analysis using the 4Ps of marketing
- Some action ideas we got from this case
- And finally, our thoughts and conclusion

We hope you enjoy it. Let’s begin.

Häagen-Dazs was founded in 1961 in New York by Reuben and Rose Mattus. Their goal was clear: to create the best-tasting ice cream using only the highest quality ingredients, with no artificial colors or flavors. Today, Häagen-Dazs is sold in over 80 countries and is known as a luxury ice cream brand. But it’s not just about the product — it’s about how they present it, and how they communicate with their customers.

One reason we chose Häagen-Dazs is because of how well they use social media to promote their brand. Their Instagram, for example, is full of beautiful photos, strong messages, and creative campaigns that connect with people emotionally. Their audience includes:
- Millennials and Gen Z who like stylish, high-quality brands
- People who enjoy food as a way to relax and feel good
- Dessert lovers who are always looking for something sweet and satisfying

Häagen-Dazs doesn't just sell ice cream. They give people a feeling — like comfort, luxury, and self-love. On social media, they show that ice cream can be more than food – it can bring joy and a nice moment in your day.

Here are 4 simple ways they give value:
1. Emotional value — They post pictures of people eating ice cream at home, after work, or during a relaxing time. It makes the brand feel personal and warm.
2. Beautiful look — Their Instagram has soft colors and pretty photos. It makes the brand look high-quality and calm. People also like to take photos and share them too.
3. Seasonal flavors — They make new flavors for each season, like sakura in spring or pumpkin spice in fall. It keeps people excited to try new things.
4. Local flavors — They create flavors for different places, like matcha in Asia and dulce de leche in Latin America. This makes people feel closer to the brand.

Let’s look at the 4Ps:

Häagen-Dazs has many kinds of products. They often make special flavors, like Japan limited editions. They also have dessert series like ice cream mooncakes and cakes, good for festivals, gifts, or parties. Collaborations with other brands or celebrities add freshness and excitement.

Häagen-Dazs is more expensive than other ice cream brands, but they emphasize natural, high-quality ingredients. They also run promotions, such as “Buy 3, Get 3 Free,” and offer attractive packaging to enhance the value perception.
