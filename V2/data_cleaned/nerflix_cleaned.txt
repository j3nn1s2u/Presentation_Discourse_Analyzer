Netflix is not just a global streaming platform — it’s also a master of social media marketing. What makes it so interesting is how it turns entertainment into marketing, using fun, engaging, and highly personalized content. That’s why we chose to study Netflix for this project.

Our outline for today includes:  
1. Background  
2. Value Creation  
3. 4Ps Analysis

5. Conclusion

background  
Netflix was founded in 1997 as a DVD rental service and began streaming in 2007. Its social media growth took off after 2010. Around 2013, with the launch of original content like *House of Cards*, Netflix's social media strategy became much stronger.

What helped Netflix succeed was its shift to localized content — creating accounts for regions like Netflix Taiwan and Netflix Japan. This made content feel more personal and relatable. Today, Netflix has over 37 million followers on Instagram, 18 million on Twitter, and over 5 million on TikTok. Their viral campaigns, memes, and original content have built a strong fan base. We chose Netflix because it combines entertainment with trend-savvy marketing.

value creation  
Netflix creates value through social media in several ways.

First, they go beyond traditional promotion. They share behind-the-scenes clips, actor interviews, and interactive content like polls, quizzes, and memes — keeping fans engaged between releases.

Their tone is casual, humorous, and internet-friendly. They talk like fans, not a corporation, making the brand feel like a friend rather than a business.

Localization is key. A meme that works in the U.S. might not make sense in Taiwan, and Netflix gets that. Their regional teams create culturally relevant content that resonates with local audiences.

Another strength is their use of data. Netflix collects vast amounts of viewing data and uses it not only for show recommendations but also to inform their marketing. If a show is trending in a specific country, they promote it more heavily there or create memes around it.

Netflix turns data into emotional connections. People feel like Netflix “gets them” because their content feels tailor-made.

4ps analysis  
**Product:**  
Netflix’s core product is its entertainment content — movies, series, documentaries. But it has expanded into games (e.g., *Stranger Things: 1984*) and merchandise (*Netflix.shop*). On social media, trailers, short clips, and interactive content become extensions of the product, enhancing engagement.

**Price:**  
Netflix operates on a subscription model with various pricing tiers. Despite being a paid service, they also share free highlights on platforms like TikTok and YouTube to attract new users. The high entertainment value makes binge-watching feel worthwhile.

**Place:**  
Netflix is active on major social platforms. On Instagram, it posts memes and stories. On TikTok, it shares short-form videos. On YouTube, it offers trailers and behind-the-scenes content. Localized accounts help make content relevant to each region.

**Promotion:**  
Netflix’s promotional strategy is creative and adaptive. They trendjack, collaborate with influencers, and encourage user-generated content. This approach gives the brand a fresh, youthful image and increases visibility.

action ideas  
Netflix's real-life social media tactics include:

- Using local language and humor to build connection.  
- Creating memes and short videos based on current trends.  
- Encouraging interaction through comments, polls, and prizes.  
- Featuring fan comments in videos to show appreciation and deepen engagement.  
- Setting clear, measurable goals such as gaining 100 fans in a month or generating 10 comments per post to track success.

closing  
Netflix uses social media not just to advertise, but to connect with fans. They know their audience, speak their language, and make content people want to share. This shows that good content and emotional connection matter more than traditional ads.

With a smart 4P strategy and a deep focus on user engagement, Netflix has become a leader in social media marketing.

As shown in engagement charts, Netflix’s rise in completion rates and online interaction proves one thing:  
**Their content strategy works.**

As Seth Godin said, “Marketing is about the stories you tell.”  
So, moving forward, we should focus not just on promotion, but on creating content that people want to share and be part of.

Let’s tell stories that truly connect.

Thank you.
