Background
Uniqlo is a Japanese brand known for minimalist, functional design. It offers high-quality, affordable products that break the stereotype that quality must be expensive. Its focus on innovative fabric technology and sustainability helps it remain competitive globally.
Founded in 1949 by Tadashi Yanai as “Ogori Shoji,” Uniqlo opened its first store in 1991. With a brand position focused on “simple, practical, and high quality,” it has gained a loyal customer base. Its technologies like HEATTECH and AIRism, and basic, minimalist designs have earned global recognition. Since entering international markets in 2001, Uniqlo has emphasized sustainability and innovation.

Research & Value Creation
Uniqlo conducts extensive market research and fabric testing to design practical clothing for daily life. It promotes sustainability through initiatives like the Re.Uniqlo project, which encourages recycling and circular economy. From thoughtful design to strict quality control, Uniqlo demonstrates strong innovation and value creation.
