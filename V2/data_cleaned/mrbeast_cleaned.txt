Opening:
Today, I’m going to introduce MrBeast, one of the most successful YouTubers worldwide.
We chose MrBeast because he is not only a YouTuber but also a master social media leader.
His marketing strategy is very unique — combining viral content, huge budgets, and philanthropy. This makes him stand out from thousands of other creators.

Background:
MrBeast’s real name is Jimmy Donaldson. He started his YouTube channel in 2012 when he was just 13 years old.
In the beginning, his videos didn’t attract much attention. But in 2017, everything changed — he became famous for his creative and extreme videos, like “Counting to 100,000”.
These kinds of videos may seem simple and boring, but they were new and very different at the time. That uniqueness helped him go viral.
Today, MrBeast has the most subscribers on YouTube — more than 380 million across all his channels.
He is also the third most followed creator on TikTok, which shows his strong presence across platforms.

Research & Value Creation:
One of the main reasons for his popularity is his extremely high video costs — he often spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on a single video, just to create unforgettable and sharable content.
MrBeast creates value for his audience in several ways.
His videos inspire viewers to take action and accomplish extraordinary things, encouraging them to push beyond their limits.
The content is filled with kindness and positivity, always uplifting and motivating those who watch.
Through his charity work and various projects, he’s making a real, tangible difference in the lives of many people.
MrBeast’s videos are unique and creative, offering original, exciting challenges that keep viewers hooked.
He also makes his content accessible to a global audience by providing multiple language audio tracks and subtitles.
What really sets him apart is the strong connection he builds with his fans, actively engaging with them and making them feel like they’re part of his journey.
MrBeast's videos feature extreme challenges and creative games, as well as large charity acts and selflessness.
Additionally, he created Feastables, a healthy snack brand with chocolates, cookies, and more.

4Ps Marketing Strategy:
Product: MrBeast earns money through ads, sponsorships, and merchandise sales like apparel and hats, which fans buy to show support.
His brand is also built around charity work, including donations, building homes, and providing free medical services.
Place: MrBeast primarily shares videos on YouTube, where millions of viewers engage with his content. He also uses Twitter (X) and Instagram for updates and promotions.
He sells his products through his website and major retailers like Walmart.
Promotion: MrBeast creates viral content with unique, high-impact challenges that attract millions of viewers. He engages with his audience by responding to comments, hosting giveaways, and involving them in charity projects.

Action Ideas:
We can use MrBeast’s ideas in school. His videos are fun, exciting, and helpful.
We can create short videos for students using the same idea.
For example:
- How to save money on lunch → Tips to spend less while still eating well.
- What is opportunity cost? → Teach students how to make smarter decisions with their money.
We will ask viewers to comment and share their own money-saving tips.
Just like MrBeast, we want to make learning both fun and easy.

Marketing Plan Using 4Ps:
Product: Short, fun videos about money tips.
Price: Videos are free, viewers “pay” by liking and sharing.
Place: Post on YouTube Shorts and Instagram.
Promotion: Create a "One week with 100 NT dollars" challenge, and ask friends to participate and share.

Execution:
Make one video every week. By using MrBeast’s ideas, we can help students and make learning more enjoyable and effective.

Closing:
From MrBeast, we learned that giving value is the key to success.
If you make fun and useful content, people will watch and share it.
MrBeast also shows the importance of collaboration.
Social media marketing is not just about selling products — it’s about helping people and building relationships.
In order to be successful, we need both engagement and creativity.
By learning from MrBeast, we can create content that both educates and entertains.
Thank you for listening!
