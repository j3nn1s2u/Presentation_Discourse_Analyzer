Opening
Hello everyone. Today we are going to analyze a unique and unexpected social media success – PX Mart, or 全聯福利中心.

At first glance, PX Mart is just a normal supermarket. But on social media, it’s known for its humorous, creative, and even “strangely entertaining” content.

We chose PX Mart because it’s a local brand that became very popular online without using celebrities or expensive ads – just great content and strong connection with the audience.

In this presentation, we’ll introduce PX Mart’s background, explore how it uses social media to create value, and analyze why its followers love and share its content.

Background
PX Mart is one of the largest supermarket chains in Taiwan. It was founded in 1998 and now has more than 1,000 stores across the country.

But what really makes PX Mart special is not just their low prices — it’s their funny, creative social media presence.

Around 2014, PX Mart started becoming very active on Facebook. Instead of using traditional ads, they began posting weird memes, old-school designs, and humorous videos.

Their posts quickly became viral because people found them funny, nostalgic, and “very Taiwanese.”

As of 2025, PX Mart has over one million followers on Facebook. Their fans often comment, share, and even create memes using PX Mart’s style.

Research & Value Creation
PX Mart’s social media creates value by giving followers fun, entertainment, and emotional connection.

Many of their posts include humor, local culture, and nostalgia. For example, they often use old-fashioned fonts and awkward music to copy the style of 90s TV ads. People find this style very funny and unique.

PX Mart doesn’t use fancy influencers. Instead, they use “ordinary” characters like the famous 全聯先生, who acts in strange, boring, and very realistic ways – just like many people in Taiwan.

Their content also feels authentic. They make jokes about everyday shopping life, which makes followers feel like, “Hey, that’s me!”

Because the content is relatable and sometimes ridiculous, people enjoy tagging their friends, leaving comments, and sharing the posts.

In this way, PX Mart builds a strong emotional bond with its audience — not by pushing products, but by making people laugh and feel connected.

This image highlights how PX Mart uses spend-and-get promotions to hook consumers. Even though the content is free, these deals cleverly turn online engagement into real-world purchases.

Place:
PX Mart strategically chooses platforms where their target audiences are most active. Their local language tone and quick, digestible formats help them blend into users’ feeds as native content rather than disruptive ads.

Promotion:
PX Mart stands out by leaning heavily on humor and unpredictability. Their ability to integrate timely trends and collaborate with influencers makes them feel modern, while their content keeps audiences guessing — and sharing.

Action Ideas
Inspired by PX Mart, I want to experiment with humor and cultural relevance in my own content strategy.

For instance, when promoting a tech product or app, I could create meme-style content that portrays the relatable frustrations of using technology — then naturally introduce my product as a solution.
Example: "Code written at 3AM vs. code written after coffee" — this type of contrast humor can make the audience laugh while still highlighting the product’s value.

Conclusion
Through the PX Mart case study, I’ve realized that even the most traditional industries can thrive online with the right tone and strategy.

PX Mart used humor and a down-to-earth style to connect with younger audiences and transform into a brand with personality.

I’ve learned that authenticity, relatability, and humor are key elements for digital-age brand success. Social media marketing isn’t just about exposure — it’s about cultural participation and engagement.

Looking ahead, as platforms and technology continue to evolve, brands that are quick to respond and human in tone will be the ones that people trust and follow.
